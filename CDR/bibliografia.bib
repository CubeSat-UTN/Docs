  abstract  = "To colonize the human small intestine, Giardia lamblia monitors
               a dynamic environment. Trophozoites attach to enterocytes that
               mature and die. The parasites must 'decide' whether to re-attach
               or differentiate into cysts that survive in the environment and
               re-activate when ingested. Other intestinal parasites face
               similar challenges. Study of these parasites is limited because
               they do not encyst in vitro. Giardia trophozoites were persuaded
               to encyst in vitro by mimicking physiological stimuli. Cysts are
               dormant, yet 'spring-loaded for action' to excyst upon
               ingestion. Giardial encystation has been studied from
               morphological, cell biological, biochemical, and molecular
               viewpoints. Yet important gaps remain and the mechanisms that
               co-ordinate responses to external signals remain enigmatic.",
